## ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Description

This is a toy project written to study how a web server works

It is written in C-Sharp, compiles and runs on any platform where the dotnet tool is available

-----

Please note that this is a work-in-progress project so API can change between single commits! Until a v1.0.0 is reached this is an expected behaviour, so it's better use the libraries provided in the "release" section
